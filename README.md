# hello-world
Traditional Hello World for GitHub

This repository is the first repository I created in GitHub. Does this editor have spell checking?  nottt shure.
##The purpose of the repository is to practice using GitHub.

### The "Copy file path to clipboard" function looks useful.

I will have to experiment with the following functions.
* Wiki
* Pulse
* Graph
* Setting
 
Branches are critical. I was suppose to make changes in the "readme-edits" branch but the list changes above where made to the master branch. 

I have one complaint. I do not see an indication of what branch I am in while I am editing this file. I see that is says "hello-world" repository.
